				<p>• Potential donors registering on this site MUST UNDERSTAND that this site is a public directory and all the information on this site is accessible to EVERYONE.

			<article>	
				<p>Hyderabad Blood Donors is a directory (just like a telephone directory), which lists names and contact details of all such people in and around Hyderabad & Secunderabad suburbs who willingly want to donate blood in case of an emergency – social or individual (defined in the next answer) and makes it available to any seeker at the click of a mouse.</p>
				<p><b>Individual Emergencies:</b> Blood Banks, just like money banks, need deposits to provide withdrawals. When a person in need of blood approaches a blood bank, the blood bank provides it, yet the blood given needs to be replenished and hence requests the seeker to get donors (relatives or friends) for the same, the incentive being subsidization of the cost per unit of blood or release of more units. During such an individual crisis, getting donors is seldom easy. Hyderabad Blood Donors comes to the aid of individuals in such a situation.</p>
				<p><b>Social Emergencies:</b> During such emergencies, the demand for blood far exceeds the amount of blood in blood banks. When communications and transit become difficult, Hyderabad Blood Donors helps to find donors.</p>
				<p>Please note that blood has a shelf life. It is important that there is proper monitoring of the stock of blood. The idea of Hyderabad Blood Donors of course is to ensure that nobody suffers due to non-availability of blood. At the same time it would be criminal to have more blood than what is required and then have it go down the drain. Therefore please do not seek blood from Hyderabad Blood Donors without doing the following:-</p>
				<p><u>If there is anyone in need of blood :</u></p>
				<p>a.) Ask the hospital to contact other blood banks in the city</p>
				<p>b.) Ask the hospital to contact the State Blood Transfusion Council really speaking, if there is a need for blood it only means that the concerned hospital has absolved itself of the responsibility of organizing blood and pushed the onus on to the hapless patient. It would also be appropriate to check if blood has already been given to the patient, and the hospital is seeking replacement, in which case there is no real emergency. It is most likely that you would be called in by someone to be a replacement donor. It would be really commendable if you donate blood as a replacement donor because your blood will be used in future emergencies and you will make the blood cheaper by a few thousands (ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 10,000) for the person who called you. It is not uncommon knowledge that medical aid comes for a heavy price and your contribution as a replacement donor can actually save somebody’s life by making the whole treatment affordable for him/her. Hyderabad Blood Donors maintains a database of blood donors and categorizes them on the basis of blood group and location. Also, contact details of the donor are required to ensure timely service. Registration is the only way of acquiring this information from people who willingly want to support our cause by registering themselves as donors. Due to the nature of its service, Hyderabad Blood Donors requires to furnish the seeker with phone numbers & e-mail address (if he had it) of blood donors. During individual emergencies, phone is the easiest way of contacting someone while during social emergencies when cellular communications break down, the internet still can be used for requesting blood. Hence, the need for giving out contact details</p>
				<p>Hyderabad Blood Donors does not sell contact details to any third party or use it in any way for commercial gains. The contact details (e-mail address and phone number) of the voluntary blood donor are made available in an automated way without any discrimination or charge to anybody who seeks donors for a particular blood group in a particular region. Hyderabad Blood Donors is a website in the public domain and is accessible to any person with an internet connection. Because of this any person or blood bank who seeks blood can obtain your contact details from the website and contact you. It is not at all compulsory to donate blood when called upon. The donor can turn down any request to donate blood if he does not wish to do so. Hyderabad Blood Donors is just a directory of people who “wish” to donate blood free of cost. Hence, it is advisable that you do not register yourself if you “never” plan to donate blood You will not be paid in anyway for donating blood. Your service will be completely voluntary and for a social cause. Donating blood for money or any commercial gain is banned by the law in India from January 1, 1996. (Source: Frontline, Volume 22 - Issue 14, Jul 02 - 15, 2005). Donors are requested to inform the seekers that they are donating voluntarily and no money should be given to any person or agent for the same.</p>

			   	1.<i>“I am too old / young”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”If you are between 18 to 55 years and in good health - you can donate”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	2.<i>“I’m underweight”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”Not if you are 45 kgs or more”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	3.<i>“But it will make me weak”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”After a short rest and a snack, you are able to resume your normal duties. The body also quickly replaces the blood given thus what is donated is not ‘lost’ from the donor”.
			    <br>
			   	<br>
			   	4.<i>“Ok, but I’m anaemic”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”Blood is checked for anaemia before every blood donation”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	5.<i>“But I’ve had hepatitis”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”Your blood is acceptable one year after full recovery”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	6.<i>“Its going to be painful”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”All you get is a tiny prick that too only momentarily Most people do not find this uncomfortable”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	7.<i>“I’m too busy and it is too inconvenient”</i>
			   	<br>
			   	”It only takes 30 minutes, and most likely you will be called to a local blood bank”.
			   	<br>
			   	<br>
			   	About 350 ml of blood is taken at the time of donation. An average person has 5-6 litres of blood in the body. The volume loss is corrected in 24-48 hours by the body. The red cells are replaced in about 56 days
			   	<br>
				The actual process of donation takes place in about 10-12 minutes. The medical check up before this and the rest period (for 5-10 minutes) after donation take up another 18-20 minutes. You are given some refreshment (eg. tea/coffee and biscuits) after donation. The whole process takes about 30-35 minutes.
				<br>
				Your health will not suffer because of blood donation. In fact, the bone marrow is stimulated to produce new blood cells. The donation process is carefully planned to be sterile and all equipment used is disposable and then discarded. There is no risk of contracting HIV/Hepatitis B etc. as all precautions are taken by the FDA-licensed blood banks
				<br>
				<br>
				Most people feel comfortable after donation. Follow instructions of the nurse/doctor to eat well, drink plenty of fluids and do not over exert yourself. Donors should not indulge in strenous exercise or activity immediately after donation.
			    </p>
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <p><u><b>Post - donation observe the following:</b></u></p>
				<p>
					• Eat light refreshment and rest for 10-15 mins<br>
					• If you are a smoker, do not smoke for atleast an hour<br>
					• Avoid heavy exercise and exertion for 24 hours<br>
					• Avoid alcohol for 24 hours<br>
					• Drink more than your usual intake of liquids during the 24 hours post donation
				<br>
				<br>
				Please have a good meal at least 3 hours before donating blood. Please accept the snacks offered to you after the donation, it is vital you have them. You are recommended to have a good meal later Please avoid smoking on the day before donating. You can smoke 3 hours after donation You will not be eligible to donate blood if you have consumed alcohol 48 hours before donation
				<br>
				<br>
				• You won’t feel drained or tired if you continue to drink fluids and have a good meal
				<br>
				• You can resume your normal activities after donating blood, though you are asked to refrain from exercise or heavy weight lifting for twelve hours after donation
				<br>
				• Donating blood will not leave you low of blood; in fact you will still have surplus blood after the donation
				<br>
				• If you choose to consume alcohol, you can on the next day
				<br>
				• While donating blood you will not feel any pain
				<br>
				• You will not faint or feel uncomfortable after donating blood. This is a common misconception
				<br>
				• You will not get AIDS if you donate blood
				<br>
				• Patients are just like donors - most of them have common blood types. Because your blood type is common, the demand for that type is greater than for rare types. So, even if your blood type is common there is still a requirement
				<br>
				• Blood donors donate blood and do not sell it
				<br>
				<br>
				Any person or a relative/friend of such a person who requires blood urgently and is unable to find donors amongst relatives, friends, acquaintances can seek blood from Hyderabad Blood Donors. Illegal agents from blood banks are strictly forbidden to access Hyderabad Blood Donors for commercial gains. Donating blood for money or any commercial gain is banned by the law in India from January 1, 1998. (Source: Frontline, Volume 22 - Issue 14, Jul 02 - 15, 2005). Donors are requested to inform the seekers that they are donating voluntarily and no money should be given to any person or agent for the same.
